# Paradigm-WPReset
Wordpress Reset used in Paradigm Websites

Author's Note: I have used variations of Eric Meyer's Reset (https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/) for years. In that time, I've made edits and added pieces that worked in my projects in wordpress. There's nothing terribly revolutionary here, but placing it here on Github offers me the opportunity to keep a steady version control and see what's out there.

I welcome any feedback or updates to this reset! 

Cheers!
